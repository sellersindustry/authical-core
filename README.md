# Authical - Core
This is the **Authical Core** for the Authical Authentication Framework, which consists of the client and server SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript) for interfacing
with the backend server. Additionally, this library provides abstract
typescripts to be shared between all Authical libraries.

### What is Authical?
Authical is an open source authentication framework that uses one-time passwords
to authenicate users. A user can simply enter their email (no matter if they are
a new user or an existing user) and they will receive an email within seconds
with a one-time password (OTP) they can enter to confirm their identity. Authical
is a easy to deploy framework that will manage one-time passwords, sessions, and
user accounts.
